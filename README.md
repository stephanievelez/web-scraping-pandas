# webscraping-dictionary
this is an introduction to taking data from the internet (in this case from wikipedia) and transforming it into a table to compare the data
four Basketball players' data were taken from wikipedia and their data were put in a python dictionary 
Panda was used to put the data from the dictionary into a nice, easy to read table
the data in the table was then used to graph and compare the data using matplotlib
